# Housing_Modeling
Final Project for UP 229: Urban Data Science. 

This Project is the Product of Allie Padget, Michael Rosen, Nicole Matteson, and Seth Reichert. 

We seek to utilize Los Angeles Building Permit Data Alongside Craigslist rental listings to better explore the possibility of predicting rental prices based upon demographic factors and the number of building permits issued.

Our final analysis is located in the the[_Final Notebook_Housing Modeling_UDS](_Final%20Notebook_Housing%20Modeling_UDS.ipynb) notebook.
