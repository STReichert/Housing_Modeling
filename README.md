# Housing_Modeling
Final Project for UP 229: Urban Data Science
This Project is the Product of Allie Padget, Michael Rosen, Nicole Matteson, and Seth Reichert
We seek to utilize Los Angeles Building Permit Data Alongside Craigslist rental listings to see if better understand and build predictive models of the Los Angeles rental housing market


# Next Steps
- find a shapefile for the city of LA
- clip the census data to be roughly the city boundaries
- join permit data to tract
- count the number of permits per tract
- join craigslist data to tracts
- calculate mean rent per SF (or bedroom)
- run linear regression on permit data & mean rents
- machine learning model:
    - bring in census variables
    - try both ways: predict rental price; or predict bldg permits
